        <div class="one">Welcome to my front-end coding portfolio! I'm Mingxi, a dedicated front-end learner with a passion for creating delightful web experiences. My goal is to transform designs into functional and responsive websites that leave a lasting impression on users.

            During my time at UCLA, I had the opportunity to refine my skills and delve into the fascinating world of user interfaces and interactive web design. This journey has ignited my curiosity and solidified my determination to excel in front-end development.
            
            What excites me the most about front-end coding is the ever-evolving technology landscape. There's always something new to learn and experiment with, whether it's a cutting-edge framework, a breakthrough in browser capabilities, or a design trend that challenges my creativity.
            
            Beyond coding, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me inspired and energized. You might catch me on the slopes, skiing down the mountains, or spending time indoors, crafting something with my hands. I'm also a bit of a tech enthusiast, and I love tinkering with small electronics projects in my spare time.
            
            I'm thrilled to be on this journey of continuous growth and improvement in the world of front-end development. Feel free to explore my portfolio, where you'll find some of my recent projects and experiments. If you have any exciting collaborations or opportunities in mind, I'd love to hear from you.</div>
